#+TITLE:6502-Assembler


After struggling using different assemblers I decided, to start writing a new 
one. I did this mainly for two reasons; The ones I used initialy (xa65, cc65)
were either too buggy or too complex for what I tried to achieve. Also, by
completely writing an assembler from scratch, I can have full controll on how
it operates, what features it has and how I can integrate it into my Project
as a whole.
