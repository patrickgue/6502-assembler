#+TITLE:Emulator and Assembler for 6502-based Microcomputer Project

* Description and History

2019-09-18

I came up with the idea of building my own 6502 based microcomputer. But I 
decided, that, before ordering any parts and trying to assemble it, I should
get familiar with all the different components. And not just on a surface level,
but in the greatest detail possible.

And this wasn't a bad idea. After only a few days working on it and only writing
a tiny part of the emulation I already learned a lot.


* The Emulator

The emulator is based on the 6502 microprocesser emulator and /Zeta/ header 
library by /Manuel Sainz de Baranda y Goñi/([https://github.com/redcode/6502], 
https://github.com/redcode/Z). The emulator is currently quite simple. In 
addition of a wrapper for the CPU emulator I've implemented a small tool 
which can load programs into memory before the system is started. 

There's a debugger implemented as a ncurses based TUI:

* The Assembler

After struggling using different assemblers I decided, to start writing a new 
one. I did this mainly for two reasons; The ones I used initialy (xa65, cc65)
were either too buggy or too complex for what I tried to achieve. Also, by
completely writing an assembler from scratch, I can have full controll on how
it operates, what features it has and how I can integrate it into my Project
as a whole.
