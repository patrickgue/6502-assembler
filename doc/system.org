#+TITLE:Operating System

* Memory

The Operating System lives in the upper part of memory; $F800 to $FFFF is the ROM, which stores all the routines which can be accessed by applications. The OS also has a part of RAM reserved for storing different values, e.g. buffers, for different purposes. These are defined as following:


** PS/2

The PS/2 input buffer is stored at $F7A0 to $F7FC. The first byte stores the
length of the current scancode buffer. The second byte stores the current bit 
position of the incoming bits. The third byte stores a /has been read/ flag, 
which is incremented after a complete byte was received, and decremented after 
a byte has been read. All the following bytes are reserved for the scancode 
buffer. 90 Bytes give an approximatly 30 (ascii) character long buffer.
